# `src/`

Path `src/` is source code for _super speedy syslog searcher_.

This code contains many `TODO`s and much debug trace printing.
If this project grows beyond a single-developer run project then code cleanup
would be considered. Until then, these leftovers may be ugly but they greatly
aid testing and development.

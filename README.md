# Super Speedy Syslog Searcher! (s4)<!-- omit in TOC -->

Speedily search and merge many syslog files by datetime.

_Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ (s4) is a command-line tool to search
and merge plain log files by datetime, including log compressed log files
(`.gz`, `.xz`) and within archives (`.tar`).
The first goal of s4 is speedy searching and printing.

## Use

### Install `super_speedy_syslog_searcher`

```lang-text
cargo install super_speedy_syslog_searcher
```

### Run `s4`

For example, print all the syslog lines in syslog files under `/var/log/`

```lang-text
s4 /var/log
```

On Windows under `C:\Windows\Logs`

```lang-text
s4.exe C:\Windows\Logs
```

Print the syslog lines after January 1, 2022 at 00:00:00

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a 20220101
```

Print the syslog lines from January 1, 2022 00:00:00 to January 2, 2022

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a 20220101 -b 20220102
```

or

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a 20220101 -b @+1d
```

Print the syslog lines on January 1, 2022, from 12:00:00 to 16:00:00

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a 20220101T120000 -b 20220101T160000
```

Print only the syslog lines since yesterday at this time

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a=-1d
```

Print only the syslog lines that occurred two days ago
(with the help of GNU `date`)

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a $(date -d "2 days ago" '+%Y%m%d') -b @+1d
```

Print only the syslog lines that occurred two days ago during the noon hour
(with the help of GNU `date`)

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -a $(date -d "2 days ago 12" '+%Y%m%dT%H%M%S') -b @+1h
```

Print only the syslog lines that occurred two days ago during the noon hour in
Bengaluru, India (timezone offset +05:30) and prepended with equivalent UTC
datetime (with the help of GNU `date`)

```lang-text
s4 /var/log -u -a $(date -d "2 days ago 00" '+%Y%m%dT%H%M%S+05:30') -b @+1h
```

### `--help`

```lang-text
Super Speedy Syslog Searcher will search syslog files and sort entries by datetime. DateTime filters
may be passed to narrow the search. It aims to be very fast.

USAGE:
    s4 [OPTIONS] <PATHS>...

ARGS:
    <PATHS>...    Path(s) of syslog files or directories. Directories will be recursed,
                  remaining on the same filesystem. Symlinks will be followed

OPTIONS:
    -a, --dt-after <DT_AFTER>
            DateTime After filter - print syslog lines with a datetime that is at or after this
            datetime. For example, "20200102T123000"

    -b, --dt-before <DT_BEFORE>
            DateTime Before filter - print syslog lines with a datetime that is at or before this
            datetime. For example, "20200102T123001"

    -t, --tz-offset <TZ_OFFSET>
            DateTime Timezone offset - for syslines with a datetime that does not include a
            timezone, this will be used. For example, "-0800", "+02:00", or "EDT". Ambiguous named
            timezones parsed from logs will use this value, e.g. timezone "IST". (to pass a value
            with leading "-", use ", e.g. "-t=-0800"). Default is local system timezone offset.
            [default: -08:00]

    -u, --prepend-utc
            Prepend DateTime in the UTC Timezone for every line

    -l, --prepend-local
            Prepend DateTime in the Local Timezone for every line

    -d, --prepend-dt-format <PREPEND_DT_FORMAT>
            Prepend DateTime using strftime format string [default: %Y%m%dT%H%M%S%.3f%z:]

    -n, --prepend-filename
            Prepend file basename to every line

    -p, --prepend-filepath
            Prepend file full path to every line

    -w, --prepend-file-align
            Align column widths of prepended data

    -c, --color <COLOR_CHOICE>
            Choose to print to terminal using colors [default: auto] [possible values: always, auto,
            never]

    -z, --blocksz <BLOCKSZ>
            Read blocks of this size in bytes. May pass decimal or hexadecimal numbers. Using the
            default value is recommended. Most useful for developers [default: 65535]

    -s, --summary
            Print a summary of files processed to stderr. Most useful for developers

    -h, --help
            Print help information

    -V, --version
            Print version information


DateTime Filter strftime specifier patterns may be:
    "%Y%m%dT%H%M%S"
    "%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z"
    "%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%:z"
    "%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%#z"
    "%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%Z"
    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z"
    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %:z"
    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %#z"
    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z"
    "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"
    "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S %z"
    "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S %:z"
    "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S %#z"
    "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S %Z"
    "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S"
    "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S %z"
    "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S %:z"
    "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S %#z"
    "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S %Z"
    "%Y%m%d"
    "%Y-%m-%d"
    "%Y/%m/%d"
    "%Y%m%d %z"
    "%Y%m%d %:z"
    "%Y%m%d %#z"
    "%Y%m%d %Z"
    "+%s",
    "+DwDdDhDmDs" or "-DwDdDhDmDs",
    @+DwDdDhDmDs" or "@-DwDdDhDmDs",

Pattern "+%s" is Unix epoch timestamp in seconds with a preceding "+".

Custom pattern "+DwDdDhDmDs" and "-DwDdDhDmDs" is relative offset from now
(program start time) where "D" is a decimal number.
Each lowercase identifier is an offset duration:
"w" is weeks, "d" is days, "h" is hours, "m" is minutes, "s" is seconds.
Value "-1w22h" would be one week and twenty-two hours in the past.
Value "+30s" would be thirty seconds in the future.

Custom pattern "@+DwDdDhDmDs" and "@-DwDdDhDmDs" is relative offset from the
other datetime.
Arguments "-a 20220102 -b @+1d" are equivalent to "-a 20220102 -b 20220103".
Arguments "-a @-6h -b 20220101T120000" are equivalent to
"-a 20220101T060000 -b 20220101T120000".

Without a timezone offset ("%z" or "%Z"), the Datetime Filter is presumed to
be the local system timezone.

Ambiguous user-passed named timezones will be rejected, e.g. "SST".

Resolved values of "--dt-after" and "--dt-before" can be reviewed in
the "--summary" output.

DateTime strftime specifier patterns are described at
https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/

DateTimes supported are only of the Gregorian calendar.

DateTimes supported language is English.

## About

_Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ (s4) is meant to aid Engineers in reviewing
varying log files in a datetime-sorted manner.
The primary use-case is to aid investigating problems wherein the time of
problem occurrence is known but otherwise there is little source evidence.

Currently, log file formats vary widely. _Most_ logs are an ad-hoc format.
Even separate log files on the same system for the same service may have
different message formats! ðŸ˜µ
Sorting these logged messages by datetime may be prohibitively difficult.
The result is an engineer may have to "hunt and peck" among many log files,
looking for problem clues around some datetime; so tedious!

Enter _Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ ðŸ¦¸ â€¼

_s4_ will print log messages from multiple log files in datetime-sorted order.
A "window" of datetimes may be passed, to constrain the period of printed
messages. This will assist an engineer that, for example, needs to view all
syslog messages that occurred two days ago among log files taken from multiple
systems.

The ulterior motive for _Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_ was the [primary
developer](https://github.com/jtmoon79) wanted an excuse to learn rust ðŸ¦€,
and wanted to create an open-source tool for a recurring need of some
Software Test Engineers ðŸ˜„

A longer rambling pontification about this project is in
[`Extended-Thoughts.md`](./Extended-Thoughts.md).

### Features

- Prepends datetime and file paths, for easy programmatic parsing or visual traversal of varying syslog messages
- Recognizes multi-line log messages
- Parses formal datetime formats:
  - [RFC 2822](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2822#section-3.3)
  - [RFC 3164](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3164#section-4.1.2)
  - [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.8)
  - [RFC 5424](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5424#section-6.2.3)
  - [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_8601&oldid=1113067353#General_principles)**
- Parses many ad-hoc datetime formats
  - Tested against "in the wild" log files from varying Linux distributions
    (see project `./logs/`)
- Comparable speed as GNU `grep` and `sort`
  (see project tool `./tools/compare-grep-sort.sh`; run in github Actions, Job
  _run s4_, Step _Run script compare-grep-sort_)
- Processes invalid UTF-8

### Limitations

- Only processes UTF-8 or ASCII encoded log files. ([Issue #16](https://github.com/jtmoon79/super-speedy-syslog-searcher/issues/16))
- Cannot processes multi-file `.gz` files (only processes first stream found) ([Issue #8](https://github.com/jtmoon79/super-speedy-syslog-searcher/issues/8))
- Cannot processes multi-file `.xz` files (only processes first stream found) ([Issue #11](https://github.com/jtmoon79/super-speedy-syslog-searcher/issues/11))
- Cannot process archive files or compressed files within other archive files or compressed files, e.g. `logs.tgz`. ([Issue #14](https://github.com/jtmoon79/super-speedy-syslog-searcher/issues/14))
  e.g. file `syslog.xz` file within file `logs.tar` will not be processed,
- Cannot process `.zip` archives ([Issue #39](https://github.com/jtmoon79/super-speedy-syslog-searcher/issues/39))
- **ISO 8601
  - ISO 8601 forms recognized
  (using [ISO descriptive format](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_8601&oldid=1114310323#Calendar_dates))
    - `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`
    - `YYYY-MM-DDThhmmss`
    - `YYYYMMDDThhmmss`
    (may use date-time separator character `'T'` or character blank space `' '`)
  - ISO 8601 forms not recognized:
    - Absent seconds
    - [_Ordinal dates_](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_8601&oldid=1114310323#Ordinal_dates), i.e. "day of the year", format `YYYY-DDD`, e.g. `"2022-321"`
    - [_Week dates_](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_8601&oldid=1114310323#Week_dates), i.e. "week-numbering year", format `YYYY-Www-D`, e.g. `"2022-W25-1"`
    - times [without minutes and seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_8601&oldid=1114310323#Times) (i.e. only `hh`)

### Hacks

- Entire `.xz` files are read into memory during the initial `open` ([Issue #12](https://github.com/jtmoon79/super-speedy-syslog-searcher/issues/12))

## More

### "syslog" definition

In this project, the term "syslog" is used generously to refer any
log message that has a datetime stamp on the first line of log text.

Technically, "syslog" is [defined among several RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Syslog&oldid=1110915683#Internet_standard_documents)
proscribing fields, formats, lengths, and other technical constraints.
In this project, the term "syslog" is interchanged with "log".

### logging chaos

In practice, most log file formats are an ad-hoc format that
may not follow any formal definition.

The following real-world example log files are available in project directory
`./logs`.

For example, the open-source nginx web server
[logs access attempts in an ad-hoc format](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/#setting-up-the-access-log) in the file `access.log`

```text
192.168.0.115 - - [08/Oct/2022:22:26:35 +0000] "GET /DOES-NOT-EXIST HTTP/1.1" 404 0 "-" "curl/7.76.1" "-"
```

which is an entirely dissimilar log format to the neighboring nginx log file,
`error.log`

```text
2022/10/08 22:26:35 [error] 6068#6068: *3 open() "/usr/share/nginx/html/DOES-NOT-EXIST" failed (2: No such file or directory), client: 192.168.0.115, server: _, request: "GET /DOES-NOT-EXIST HTTP/1.0", host: "192.168.0.100"
```

nginx is following the example set by the apache web server (a bad example!).

<br/>

Commercial software and computer hardware vendors nearly always use
ad-hoc log message formatting that is even more unpredictable among each log
file on the same system.

```text
09/15/2022 14:13:22.951 [515]: 1>Warning: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly
```

And a snippet from the same Windows host, log file
`${env:SystemRoot}/Performance/WinSAT/winsat.log`

```text
68902359 (21103) - exe\logging.cpp:0841: --- START 2022\5\17 14:26:09 PM ---
68902359 (21103) - exe\main.cpp:4363: WinSAT registry node is created or present
```

(yes, it reads hour `14`, and `PM`â€¦  ðŸ™„)

<br/>

This chaotic logging approach is typical of commercial and open-source software.
And it's a mess!
Attempting to sort log messages by their natural sort mechanism,
a datetime stamp, is difficult to impossible.

Hence the need for _Super Speedy Syslog Searcher_!

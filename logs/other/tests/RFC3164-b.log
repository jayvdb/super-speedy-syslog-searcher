<165>Oct  2 23:00:03 host1 program[1]: The TIMESTAMP field is the local time and is in the format of "Mmm dd
   hh:mm:ss" (without the quote marks) where:
<165>Oct  2 23:00:03 host1 program[1]:          Mmm is the English language abbreviation for the month of the
         year with the first character in uppercase and the other two
         characters in lowercase.  The following are the only acceptable
         values:

         Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec

         dd is the day of the month.  If the day of the month is less
         than 10, then it MUST be represented as a space and then the
         number.  For example, the 7th day of August would be
         represented as "Aug  7", with two spaces between the "g" and
         the "7".
         hh:mm:ss is the local time.  The hour (hh) is represented in a
         24-hour format.  Valid entries are between 00 and 23,
         inclusive.  The minute (mm) and second (ss) entries are between
         00 and 59 inclusive.

<165>Oct  2 23:00:03 host1 program[1]:    A single space character MUST follow the TIMESTAMP field.

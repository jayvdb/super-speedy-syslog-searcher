<13>Oct  1 00:00:04 host2<34>Oct 1 00:00:04 host1 program: Since the beginning, life has relied upon the transmission of
messages.  For the self-aware organic unit, these messages can relay
many different things.  The messages may signal danger, the presence
of food or the other necessities of life, and many other things.  In
many cases, these messages are informative to other units and require
no acknowledgement.  As people interacted and created processes, this
same principle was applied to societal communications.  As an
example, severe weather warnings may be delivered through any number
of channels - a siren blowing, warnings delivered over television and
radio stations, and even through the use of flags on ships.  The
expectation is that people hearing or seeing these warnings would
realize their significance and take appropriate action.  In most
cases, no responding acknowledgement of receipt of the warning is
required or even desired.  Along these same lines, operating systems,
processes and applications were written to send messages of their own
status, or messages to indicate that certain events had occurred.
These event messages generally had local significance to the machine
operators.  As the operating systems, processes and applications grew
ever more complex, systems were devised to categorize and log these
diverse messages and allow the operations staff to more quickly
differentiate the notifications of problems from simple status
messages.  The syslog process was one such system that has been
widely accepted in many operating systems.  Flexibility was designed
into this process so the operations staff have the ability to
configure the destination of messages sent from the processes running
on the device.  In one dimension, the events that were received by
the syslog process could be logged to different files and also
displayed on the console of the device.  In another dimension, the
syslog process could be configured to forward the messages across a
network to the syslog process on another machine. The syslog process
had to be built network-aware for some modicum of scalability since
it was known that the operators of multiple systems would not have
the time to access each system to review the messages logged there.
The syslog process running on the remote devices could therefore be
configured to either add the message to a file, or to subsequently
forward it to another machine.
